Python needs to be English, not Sanskrit
=========================================


If you are born and brought up in India, chances are that English and Sanskrit will be introduced to you at a very young age. A third the size of Europe, this country can offer as many or more languages; then why English and Sanskrit? 

The English language, a vestige of India's colonial past, has been around for centuries and shaped Indian society, education, economy, governance and almost all other aspects of the country. Sanskrit had a similar role in ancient India. A vast amount of literature, art and philosophy of our past survives through this language, albeit much has been lost.

But today, Sanskrit is a dead language. A language will die when it has self-anointed guardians who define what is and what is not the "True" language. These guardians may have became the experts of a version and style of the language. This version and style will be imposed on everybody else using their authority. 

To me, Python represents English. It is accessible, connects me to a larger group, and just as loaned and coined up words are there to easily represent new ideas in English, the libraries of Python exist to make life effortless. What worries me is the day when English python might turn into Sanskrit python. I worry about the extra training that newcomers may need to put in to become good at Python. When first introduced to python2, I felt that it was a language with which I could do what I like. Python3, for whatever the changes are worth, had lost some of that freedom. I hope that further changes will not take us in a direction where further and further effort will be demanded from whoever is coming to join the community of Python.
